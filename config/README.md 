# Configuration


This directory contains the configuration for the whole Spryker Framework as well as configurations for Symfony Bundles.


## Application Configuration


Each application has its own directory where specific to that application configurations are stored. The main applications are:


- `Yves`: The front-end application.
- `Zed`: The back-end application.
- `Glue`: The API application.
- `GlueBackend`: The Backend API application.
- `GlueStorefront`: The Storefront API application.
- `Shared`: Configuration shared across all applications.


On top of that, there is a directory (`config/install/`) that contains install configurations.


Each Application can have the following configuration files:
- `config/{Application}/ApplicationServices.php`: Configuration for the application where services are defined which are available through the Dependency Injection container.
- `config/{Application}/bundles.php`: Configuration for the bundles that are provided from Symfony, 3rd party provider, or Spryker.


## Symfony Bundle Configuration


Symfony Bundle configurations are stored in the `config/{Application}/packages/` directory. Each bundle has its own configuration file named after the bundle, for example:


- `config/Zed/packages/framework.yaml`: Configuration for the Symfony FrameworkBundle in the Zed application.


### Bundle Configuration


Each bundle that get registered in the `config/{Application}/bundles.php` can have it's own configuration file in the `config/{Application}/packages/` directory. The configuration file is named after the bundle and uses the appropriate format (YAML, XML, PHP) based on the project's configuration preferences.


Spryker promotes using the PHP format for configuration files, as it allows for more complex logic and better integration with the Spryker ecosystem.


A configuration file written in PHP might look like this:


```php
<?php


/**

 * Use of this software requires acceptance of the Evaluation License Agreement. See LICENSE file.
 */


declare(strict_types=1);


use Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Loader\Configurator\ContainerConfigurator;


use Symfony\Config\FrameworkConfig;


return static function (FrameworkConfig $framework, ContainerConfigurator $containerConfigurator): void {
    $framework->secret('Your Framework secret');
}
```


There are a couple of things to note in this example:
- This callback function receives two parameters: an instance of `FrameworkConfig` and an instance of `ContainerConfigurator`; Those are optional and can be defined on demand.
- The `FrameworkConfig` instance does not exist and is created right before the callback is called. This is Symfony specific and uses `\Symfony\Component\Config\Definition\Builder\TreeBuilder` provided inside the respective bundle which is used to generate this specific class on the fly.
- The `ContainerConfigurator` instance is created by Symfony and can be used to configure services, parameters, and other container-related settings.


It is up to you to you what you request to be passed into the callback. You can omit the generated config as well as the `ContainerConfigurator` when not needed.
