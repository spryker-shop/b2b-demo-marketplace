# Cross-Cutting Concepts

This section documents overall principles, patterns, and solution ideas that are relevant across multiple building blocks of the system rather than being isolated to single components. Examples include: logging conventions, authentication/authorization approaches, common design patterns, domain models, error handling strategies, etc. Focus on the most important concepts that span your system and explain how they work in practice with real implementation examples and diagrams.
